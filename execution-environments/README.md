## Available EEs
The current plan is two have two images based on fedora that are same/close to the community images, additionally an execution environment for el8 which will be put into "maintenance only" mode when ansible 2.16 retires this year, plus el9 execution ens that will get updated as long as there is an ansible core version that supports python 3.9. The el9 EEs are split into several ones with different selections of pre-installed collections
